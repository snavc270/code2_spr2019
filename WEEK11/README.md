# AGENDA
1. Review HW 
2. End of semester check in 
3. Recursion 
4. LSystems 



### Recursion 
Simply put, recursion is a function which calls inside it's function. A recursive method is defined by the following two properties: 

1. Base case = terminating case that does not use recursion to generate it's value. 
2. Rules = a set of rules that reduce all other cases closer to the base case.

### LSystems 
Aka Lindenmayer system was developed by Aristid Lindenmayer in order to describe the behavior and growth of plant cells (algae). It is essentially a set of rules iterated a certain number of generations. 

1. axiom = A ; where your LSystem starts. 
2. rules : (A ->AB) , (B->A) 

These rules generate....

...and can be used to generate...

### Homework 
1. Modify our LSystem to generate a new pattern
2. Final project proposals. You should have some idea of what you want to build, and a list of 3 concepts you want to explore.
