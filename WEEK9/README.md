# AGENDA 
1. Review midterms 
2. Exporting and importing data exercise  
3. Markov chains 
4. N-grams
5. Text generation with markov chains


### What is a markov chain? 
Mathematical systems that hop from one state to another. 

### What is an n-gram? 
Basically a sequence of characters or words. Bi-grams = sequence of two. Tri-grams = sequence of three.  


### Extra resources: 
[Markov chains resource](http://setosa.io/blog/2014/07/26/markov-chains/)

### Homework
1. Schedule one-on-one tutoring to make up questions missed on the midterm
2. Use a markov chain to generate a short poem or story (hint, watch Daniel schiffman videos. this is very difficult but give it a try!)

### Challenge 
1. Draw a scene based on your story generated
